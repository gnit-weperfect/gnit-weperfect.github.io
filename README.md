   For Webinar BigBlueButton, which is a completely open-source web-conferencing system, is used.
  

   For Video-conferencing the 100% encrypted and completely open source Jitsi Meet platform is used so as to deliver the best video conferencing 
   experience. 
  

   Here are some of the features of the Jitsi Meet platform, which has made it a platfrom of choice.
   
   * It is 100% encrypted, so all communications passing through it are secure.
   
   * It is completely open-source, which increases the possibility of security vulnerabilities getting spotted and fixed.
   
   * It doesn't require an account to use the platform, which means greater privacy for the users.
   

    And for E-learning Moodle is used, which is one of the best open source learning management system (lms) available.

    
    A Whiteboard is also made available by the solution, using WBO which is a 'free and collaborative online whiteboard'.
 

    The links to the respective features of the platform is available in the [official website](https://gnit-weperfect.github.io).
